Maggie figured out early on in “Stories We Tell Ourselves” that Tommaso had told the Croat about their plan, which is why the Burazi were ready for them when he “found” oxygen tanks for them so they wouldn’t have to breathe methane in the sewer system.</p><p>This was shown when he “found” oxygen tanks by chance, saving them from leaving methane in the sewer system. The Croat had stopped Tommaso’s famous “escape,” he said. He made a deal with the psycho to trade the sites of their hideouts for a boat off the island.</p><p><strong>A Tweet by TVLine on the recap of episode 5:&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Sunday’s episode of <a href=# rel=noopener>#TWDDeadCity</a> featured almost as many betrayals as it did walkers — and there were a *lot* of walkers! <a href=#>https://t.co/zkX9MTeYKw</a></p><p>— TVLine.com (@TVLine) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 17, 2023</a></p><p>He hoped this would save his life and the lives of everyone else. Amaia was scared, but only for a short time. Some walkers who had been sleeping just woke up in time to kill her and her boyfriend. As Negan and Perlie tried to avoid the dead, they talked to each other.</p><p>The first person said that if Perlie had seen how the judge and his friends had left Annie, he would have killed the judge and his friends. The latter said that, before the end of the world, he had been told to send away his beloved brother Joel because his drug use made him a danger to their parents.</p><p>Because of this, Joel died alone. Had he done something wrong? Perlie used to answer yes. But now… Hmm. In another part of New York City, the Croat went to a theatre where “Anything Goes” was being done in a crazy way. “staged” feels like the wrong word. Happening. That’s fine with us.</p><p><strong>Check out for another series recap if you missed the episode somehow:</strong></p><p>He seemed to work for a woman who looked like Patti LuPone. (Who would have thought?) She didn’t like that he’d let Negan escape since he was essential to stopping the Marshals from destroying their new world order. Still, she let the Croat go with his one surviving ear, and before he left, she patted him on the head. Maggie finally figured out why Ginny was so mean to her.</p><p>She told Negan that she hadn’t shown him the girl’s dinosaur because he would have taken her to the Bricks, and Glenn’s widow needed his help. The Croat had taken all of her people’s food and Hershel. If he weren’t stopped, her people would starve. Maggie’s foot eventually got stuck in… ugh.</p><p>Was that the chest of a walker? She told Ginny to run away while she fought off a weird Walker monster, which is probably the worst Walker in the franchise’s history, right? When Maggie went to find Ginny, she found a note in the blood that said “LIAR.” As Ginny fired the flare gun to let Negan know where she was, flashbacks showed that the Croat hadn’t taken the Bricks’ grain but had instead taken Hershel to get Maggie to bring him Negan, whose WANTED poster he’d left her with.</p><p>We come back again with some new updates.
