Besides his TV show Bill Nye the Science Guy, he is well-known for his Netflix show Bill Nye Saves the World which started airing in 2017 as well as his appearances in many famous media projects as a science educator.&nbsp; The star studied mechanical engineering but expanded his&nbsp;career to science communicating, and television presenting. Here’s everything to know about his early days.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-nyes-age-education></span><strong>Bill Nye’s Age & Education</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bill Nye’s birthdate is November 27, 1955, and his birth sign is Sagittarius. He spent his early childhood in Washington D. C where he was born. His parents played an active role in World War II with his mom, Jacqueline Jenkins Nye serving as a codebreaker who broke the codes used by the Japanese and German military during the war while his dad, Edwin Darby “Ned” Nye also served during the war as a contractor. He was the contractor that constructed an airstrip on Wake Island.</p><p>Nye received a scholarship to attend Sidwell Friends for his high school education following his elementary school and Junior high education at Lafayette Elementary School and Alice Deal Junior High. As a child, he had a deep passion for science, so he relocated to Ithaca to join Cornell University New York and takes classes in sciences at Sibley School of Mechanical Aerospace Engineering. In 1977 he completed his studies there and obtained a BS in mechanical engineering.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><strong>Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shortly after graduation in 1977, Nye joined the Boeing Corporation which produces and sells aircraft, satellite, rotorcrafts, missiles, and rockets. There, he innovated a hydraulic resonance suppressor tube which is used for the construction of Boeing 747 airplanes. He also spent time at Sundstrand Data Control near Seattle around this time. He gave entertainment a chance in 1986 after he tried a few times to get a chance to be part of NASA astronauts training program but was turned down.</p><p>His first engagement was in standup comedy which saw him making impressions of Steve Martin at events. While he found it rewarding getting others to roar with laughter, Nye didn’t leave his engineering duties at Boeing. He continued to juggle between comedy and working on business jet navigation systems and laser gyroscope system – which were the activities he had in hand then. One lucky night, as he was performing an open mic show, a famous comedian, John Keister discovered him and introduced him to Almost Live, a sketch comedy TV show.</p><p>Nye had to give up his job in 1986 to focus more on the entertainment. He began acting and writing on the famous TV show and won the audience the day he comically described what happens when you eat a marshmallow immersed in liquid nitrogen. After a few stints on the show which consistently increased his fan base, Nye created his own show titled Bill Nye the Science Guy in 1993. Similarly, the show found enormous success and its prominence made it one of the most-watched in the U.S.</p><p>At the of the end of the show in 1998, Nye started another exploit named The Eye of Nye which also tackled science subjects. Since the 2000s, Nye has worked on numerous media schemes including TV appearances with science themes. He is known as one of the loudest voices speaking up for science and has also written three science books including Unstoppable: Harnessing Science to Change the World, amongst others.</p><p>The excellence of his many science projects has also won him many&nbsp;honorary doctorates of science from different universities such as&nbsp;Lehigh University, Willamette University and a lot more.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-his-wife-and-children></span><strong>Meet His Wife and Children</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nye was married to Blair Tindall, an American writer, motivational speaker, and musician. She wrote the Mozart in the Jungle which inspired the Amazon series of the same name featuring Gael Bernal. After his proposal to her, Nye&nbsp;surprised&nbsp;her with a spontaneous wedding in 2006. But their marriage wasn’t considered legal by the State of Califonia and although he was lip-tight about giving the reason why the marriage was regarded as illegal, Nye annulled the marriage some weeks later. The following year, Nye received a 6-year protective letter against his ex-wife of seven weeks for breaking into his home, taking some items including his laptop and impersonating him through emails. There was also an&nbsp;event where his ex-wife, Blair was accused of using poisonous chemical on his precious garden. Later on, Nye sued her for failing to keep the protective order.</p><p>Currently, Bill Nye is single and seems not to have any child yet. Although when you search for his child, Google automatically gives Charity Nye as an answer, it is important to note that there is no much information about this lady and Bill has never linked any child to himself.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-his-net-worth></span><strong>What Is His Net Worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bill Nye’s famous TV show might have ended since 1998 but it didn’t end without enriching him. The passion that he didn’t overlook (which aired 100 episodes in five seasons starting from 1993) has helped his net worth grow to about $6.5 million. Of course,&nbsp;not all shows can generate such a rewarding amount of wealth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-he-dead-or-alive></span><strong>Is He Dead or Alive?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bill Nye is among the many celebrities whose death news went viral and later turned to be blatantly false. It all started on Twitter and before he could say anything, lots of social media users started mourning the educator. As the mourning increased, Bill Nye made a major appearance using a YouTube video where he spoke against “creationism” to indirectly announce that he is still living. The video which gathered millions of views was titled “Creationism Is Not Appropriate For Children” and was published on Big Think.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time the world has rumored the American&nbsp;scientist’s death and nobody is sure how it kicks off in the first place. However, some have suggested that it all started with an article fabricated on The Onion that said Nye&nbsp;died in an accident while he was filling hot air balloon by blending baking soda and vinegar. Others think the rumor was an attack on him for criticizing religion. Whatever started it, the truth remains that Nye is alive and is not leaving his scientific researches for anybody yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYq%2BquMtmpbKdXam1pnnSnKCeppOaeqjB2GabnpmUYryzecCloK%2BdXay1osCMmqmeZZiewG66xK1ksKeiqbVuscOumpqsmaS7cA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./suits-recap-62415-season-5-episode-1-premiere-denial.html>&#171;&nbsp;Suits Recap Premiere Spoilers: Season 5 Episode 1 Denial</a>
