Strong is best known for being a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series "Saturday Night Live" (2012–present).

She grew up in Oak Park, Illinois, with mother Penelope and father Bill (a former Associated Press bureau chief). Cecily's parents are divorced, and Penelope works as a nurse practitioner, while Bill owns a public relations firm. As a child, Strong reenacted "SNL" sketches with a friend and repeatedly watched a tape of the show's best commercials. During her youth, she often attended Broadway shows, thanks to her uncle's career as a Broadway producer, and she sometimes got to meet the casts. Cecily attended Oak Park and River Forest High School, but she was expelled during her sophomore year for bringing cannabis onto school grounds. She subsequently went to a private Catholic school, then she transferred to the Chicago Academy for the Arts during her senior year. After graduating in 2002, Strong enrolled at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), earning a BFA in theatre in 2006. She then moved back to Chicago and trained at iO Chicago and the Second City Conservatory.

First-year cast members make $7,000 per episode, or $147,000 per season. Second-year cast members make $8,000 per episode, or $168,000 per season. If a cast member makes it to their fifth season, they make $15,000 per episode, or $315,000 per season. The highest salary that can be reached at "SNL" is for people who've been there the longest or are the most important to the show. They make $25,000 per episode, or $525,000 per year. It is likely that Cecily is in that higher level salary echelon due to her tenure.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Cecily was close to her younger cousin, Owen Strong, who sadly passed away from brain cancer in January 2020. She wrote about the process of mourning Owen's death in a "Vulture" essay in April 2020 and in her 2021 memoir, "This Will All Be Over Soon." Strong gave a beautiful eulogy at Owen's memorial service in which she called him her hero and stated that while her cousin was going through cancer, he showed his family and friends how to fight, smile, and "stay full of love." In the essay and the book, Cecily also wrote about her relationship with a man named Jack, who she met at a Christmas party in 2019. Jack caught COVID-19 early in the pandemic, and Strong wrote of her feelings during that time, "I'm scared about Jack. I'm really scared. He has had a bad fever for a week. He didn't answer his phone yesterday. I text a doctor friend who suggests a police welfare check. I have had anxiety and depression since high school. I take Wellbutrin. I've gone to years of therapy. I take Xanax when needed. This is a really bad time for mental health." In November 2021, inspired by her own experience with abortion, Cecily appeared in a "Weekend Update" segment as Goober the Clown to speak out against Texas' "heartbeat law," which would ban abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. Strong later said in an Instagram story, "I didn't tell my own wonderful and supportive mom for years and Saturday I told live TV."</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>Strong earned Primetime Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for "Saturday Night Live" in 2020 and 2021. The show has also earned her a Gold Derby Award nomination for Comedy Supporting Actress (2021) and three Online Film & Television Association Award nominations – Best Female Performance in a Fiction Program (2014) and Best Female Performance in a Variety Program (2019 and 2020). "Schmigadoon!" has been nominated for a 2022 Grammy for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>Though Cecily spends most of the year in New York City, where she lives in an apartment that has "a bed in [the] kitchen" (according in to a 2018 "People" magazine article), she also owns a home in Los Angeles. She enlisted designer Nicole Palczynski to help her renovate the two-bedroom, two-bathroom home, and she moved into her new abode during the spring of 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqku8yem6KZnqh8pLHCoqOyZaOpv7C6xmalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./pippa-middleton-former-london-family-home-17-million.html>&#171;&nbsp;Pippa Middleton's former 17m five-floor mansion she gave up for quiet country life</a>
