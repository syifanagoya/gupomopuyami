K. Rowling</a>. Sudol plays Queenie Goldstein, the younger sister of Tina (Katherine Waterston), alongside Newton "Newt" Scamander (Eddie Redmayne). The film is set in New York sixty-five years before Harry Potter's story starts, is based on the Hogwarts textbook of the same name, and follows the adventures of its author, "magizoologist" Newt Scamander. The film was released in November. Sudol reprised the role in the film's 2018 sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.</p><p>For Season 1 of the television series Transparent, Sudol and fellow cast member Clementine Creevy recorded a cover of Jim Croce's song "Operator (That's Not The Way It Feels)" under the band name Glitterish. A full version of the song was included on the Transparent soundtrack album, released in December 2014.</p><p>In 2014, Sudol focused on her acting career and starred as Kaya in the recurring cast of the first season of Amazon Video series Transparent.

Elle named Sudol one of "The 7 Most Exciting Newcomers on TV this Season" in January 2015.</p><p>On October 31, 2011, Sudol stated via Twitter that the band was mastering their new record.

She designed three tee shirts for Alternative Apparel in support for IUCN.</p><p>In her music career, Sudol used the moniker A Fine Frenzy, taken from the phrase "in a fine frenzy rolling" (i.e., rolling in the ecstasy of inspiration), in William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, Act V, Scene 1.

In September 2008, she was the star act on the opening night of the New Pop Festival organized by the German broadcaster SWR3.

Additionally, in October 2008, "You Picked Me" was chosen as network theme by SIC, a Portuguese television network. To date, One Cell in the Sea has sold 300,000 copies. In 2008 it was released in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Poland. In each of those countries, the album peaked within the top 30, with the first single, "Almost Lover," reaching number eight in Germany, number ten on the Swiss Charts and number five in Austria.
