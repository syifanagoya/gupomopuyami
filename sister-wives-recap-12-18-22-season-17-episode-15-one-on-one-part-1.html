with one-on-one interviews and it starts with Kody, Suki congratulates him on being a grandpa again. She brings up him and Christine. He says the last conversation they had, Christine was decided entirely and he was in denial. He says he was not attracted to Christine because he felt betrayed by her.</p><p>He reveals that he was not attracted to her when he married her and she is shocked. She tells him right out that she doesn’t want to be married to him anymore. Back to Suki, Kody says that was four years of context. He thought she was playing a game because she is a game player. Manipulation, pouting, temper tantrums, just behavior things. Suki tells him that is very cold to say. He gives her examples, like when he wanted to reconcile with Mere and Christine lost her shit. She came to a family party and left yelling.</p><p>Suki asks Christine about what Kody said and she says they were fighting forever. She thinks Kody would have been fine if they had a platonic, not even friends, marriage. Meri doesn’t like that she was brought into their conversation.</p><p>Kody says they can’t talk things out because the relationships are not good.</p><p>Janelle says she knew Christine was not happy and she thinks she reached the point that for her own happiness she had to do something.</p><p>Robyn says she would not allow Kody not to talk to her, she makes sure they talk things through. She thinks that Kody has a tendency to be attracted to a wife’s behavior.</p><p>Christine says it was a relief when Kody said he wasn’t attracted to her, because she was no longer attracted to him and she was done. She also didn’t like when he said she had “bad behavior” she is not his child and she found it belittling.</p><p>Kody thinks COVID was a catalyst. Suki asks Kody why he hung on so long, why he couldn’t accept that it was over.</p><p>Robyn says that she hoped Kody and Christine could have worked things out, and she is still trying to process that Christine is no longer her sister’s wife. She always thought that Christine would eventually open up to her. She imagined that when they were older they would be sitting there with their grandchildren. Then she thought if Kody was out of the picture, things might be different and they could have a relationship. She wishes that Christine let her in, they could have had a lot of fun together.</p><p>Christine admits that she thinks Robyn is heartbroken. In years, she hasn’t had a good relationship with Meri. And, she felt like she did let Robyn in.</p><p>Meri says she felt betrayed when Christine said she was going to leave. Meri says she has not always been the perfect wife or sister wife, but she feels abandoned by Christine.</p><p>Kody says he was not sure that Christine was going to go ahead with the divorce. He blames himself though because he should have been the head of the family. He told all ladies that they had to run their wills to him because he had to take care of all the wives. Meri admits that she subscribes to patriarchy. Janelle says it is nothing she agreed to and now he wants it, she says he changed his tune. Janelle says they were going to work together as a team to take care of the family. She thinks he now wants a relationship alone with Robyn.</p><p>Kody says he really doesn’t feel like he is married to Meri and if she wanted to move on he wouldn’t oppose it.</p><p>Janelle says there are steps that Kody and Christine are supposed to take within the church to divorce. Although, Robyn says once Christine has sex with someone else, the marriage is over because that is adultery.</p><p>Janelle thinks Christine is looking for a deep connection.</p><p>Meri says that she always felt like she was married to Kody, but he pulled away and she felt like they should have addressed it publicly, but he didn’t want to. She says she would think about reconciliation but she doesn’t think he is interested.</p><p>Kody says Meri made rise Krispy treats for him and he loved the gesture and it made him want to reconcile with her. But Meri says his feeling didn’t last long because she wanted to kiss him later that night and he was like a board and pulled back.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtno57AtbHRZq6irpWoerOxwpqnZmliYn55eZFrZKydkai8r3mQcGSeqJmovKWxjGpsZqeemnqwuoyopZ5loJa%2FtXmQaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./alim-beisembayev.html>&#171;&nbsp;Alim Beisembayev Wiki, Piano, Leeds, Wikipedia</a>
